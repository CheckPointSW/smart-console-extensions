# Show Gateways Interfaces

An HTML and JavaScript example for Check Point SmartConsole extension

Show interfaces in a dedicated tab under the gateway’s view.
Currently, in order to see the topology of a gateway\cluster, one need to open the object editor and navigate to the topology tab. This extension will show the topology of a gateway under the gateway’s view, and saves the need to open the editor.
